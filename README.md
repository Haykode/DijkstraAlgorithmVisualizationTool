# Dijkstra Algorithm Visualization Tool    
## Introduction
This program visualizes the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm using **EasyX** and demonstrates how the algorithm finds the shortest path in a graph. The visualization provides an intuitive understanding of the algorithm's mechanics and practical applications in graph theory.

This tool was developed as the final project for the course **‘Data Structures’** during my time at university.
